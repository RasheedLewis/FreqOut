The Sound Design folder contains a processing file that I have commented to make it easy to
understand.

Don't worry about most of the file, just look at the top 10 or so lines for my TODO comments.
Here, you can change specific float values to change the output sound for each emotion
if you want to do some tinkering.

Feel free to add on to this if you want, so far I can only figure out basic sine/square/triangle
wave sounds.
